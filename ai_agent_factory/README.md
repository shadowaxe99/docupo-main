### Workflow

The typical workflow is:

1. The user provides the high-level goals and requirements for the project to the Taskmaster agent.

2. The Taskmaster agent asks the Architect agent to design the architecture and plan the project structure.

3. The Taskmaster then delegates tasks to the specialized agents:

   - The Writer agent implements the code based on the architecture.
   - The Frontender agent creates and styles the UI.
   - The Editor agent refactors and improves the code quality.
   - The QA agent tests the project, finds bugs, and provides feedback.
   - The Devops agent handles deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.

4. Throughout the process, the user periodically reviews the work and provides feedback and guidance to the Taskmaster.

5. The agents continue iterating, improving the code, fixing issues, and implementing new features based on the user feedback.

The goal is to maximize the amount of work the agents can do autonomously, while still allowing the user to guide the overall direction. The user essentially oversees the project at a high-level while the agents handle the implementation details.

### Memory

To track state between conversations, the Taskmaster maintains a memory of the key information about the project:

- The current architecture
- The files that have been written
- Known issues and bugs
- To-do items and future plans

The memory allows the agent to pick up where it left off when the user re-engages with it.

### Future Work

There are many potential areas for future improvement:

- Implement more specialized agents like a Designer, Researcher, etc.
- Improve the agents' ability to explain their reasoning and actions.
- Enable the agents to proactively ask for help when stuck.
- Integrate a database to allow more complex applications.
- Expand the agents' knowledge with public code repositories like GitHub.
- Allow deployments to real hosting platforms.

The goal is to eventually have an AI assistant capable of developing real-world software projects with minimal human involvement. There is still much progress to be made, but Clippy demonstrates the potential for AI to automate programming work.
